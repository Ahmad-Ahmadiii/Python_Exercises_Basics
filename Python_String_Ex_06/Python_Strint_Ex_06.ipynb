    " 1)  Write a program to read through the **mbox-short.txt** and figure out who has sent the **greatest number of mail messages.** The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes the second word of those lines as the person who sent the mail. The program creates a **Python dictionary** that maps the sender's mail address to a count of the number of times they appear in the file. After the dictionary is produced, the program reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.\n",
